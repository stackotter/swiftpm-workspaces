## SwiftPM Workspaces (WIP)

Vend multiple SwiftPM packages from a single repository. Made possible by
a custom implementation of SwiftPM's Package Registry specification and a measly
config file.

### Aim

SwiftPM Workspaces aims to implement a system akin to Rust's [Cargo Workspaces](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html),
but for those of us deep in the SwiftPM ecosystem.

### Usage

This is still WIP and doesn't yet have a configuration file format (some of my
repositories are hardcoded in for testing purposes). If you're interested, watch
the repository and you'll get notified once I start working on this again! The First
order of business will be making it easier to try out.
